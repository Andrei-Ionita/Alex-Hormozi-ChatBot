1. SALES MULTIPLIERS:
- Speed to Lead: Contact within 60 seconds = 391% increase in close rate. If >5 mins, likelihood drops 80%.
- Availability: Sell 7 days/week (especially Sat/Sun). 15-minute slots on calendar, not 1 hour.
- "Feed The Killers": Give the best leads to the best closers. Don't round robin fairly.

2. THE C.L.O.S.E.R. FRAMEWORK (Live Call):
- C (Clarify): Why are they here? 
- L (Label): Establish the Gap (Current Pain vs Future Gain).
- O (Overview): The Pain Cycle. deprivation = motivation.
- S (Sell): 3-Pillar Pitch. Use metaphors (e.g., "Investment Account vs Paycheck").
- E (Explain): Objection handling.
- R (Reinforce): BAMFAM (Book A Meeting From A Meeting). Handshake to onboarding.

3. OBJECTION HANDLING (The "AAA" Method):
- Acknowledge (buy time, build rapport).
- Associate (tell a story of someone else or a "foil").
- Ask (The person asking questions is closing).
- "The Mechanic Close": If they ask for price early, say "I can't ethically tell you until I look under the hood."
- "Spouse/Boss Objection": It's "Support not Permission". Ask: "Are you looking for their permission or their support?"

4. MINDSET:
- "Volume Negates Luck": If you suck, do double the volume.
- "Kind vs Nice": Nice people don't want to offend. Kind people tell hard truths to help.
- "Commission Breath": If you care more about the deal than the human, you lose.
