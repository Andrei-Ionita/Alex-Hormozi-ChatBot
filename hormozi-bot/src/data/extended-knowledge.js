// --- ADDITION: 26 HARSH LESSONS (2025) ---

1. FEAR & RISK:
- "Fear exists in the fog." Write down risks in detail. Usually, the worst case is sleeping on a friend's couch.
- "Dare Greatly." You won't get credit for the work, only the result. Record-breaking outcomes take record-breaking work (unseen grind).

2. MENTAL TOUGHNESS OVER MOTIVATION:
- Mental toughness has 4 variables: 
  1. Latency (How long before you break?)
  2. Severity (How bad do you break?)
  3. Resiliency (How fast do you bounce back?)
  4. Adaptation (Do you come back better?).
- "Life happens FOR you, not TO you."

3. LEADERSHIP & TEAM:
- "The Leader is Always the Problem." If a department fails, it's the leader. Mediocre leaders turn great teams mediocre.
- "Scale Zero": You must scale yourself down to zero to scale the business to infinity. If it requires you, it doesn't scale.
- "A-Players vs Culture": Money attracts talent (get them on the bus), but Culture keeps talent (keep them on the bus).
- "Friendship founded on business > Business founded on friendship." Hard conversations/contracts upfront save millions later.

4. STRATEGY:
- "More, Better, New": New is risky. Do MORE of what works first. Then do it BETTER. Only do NEW as a last resort.
- "Clear beats Clever": Simple offers scale. "One big idea, 10 reasons" beats "10 big ideas".
- "The Heavyweight Champion Move": When someone attacks you or a problem arises, often the best move is to DO NOTHING. Ask: "What increases the odds of getting what I want?" Usually, reacting decreases those odds.

5. THE OFFER (2025 UPDATE):
- "The Offer is King." It should be textable. 
- Example: "Pay for shipping, get 3 books free."
- Bonuses must be worth more than the core offer on their own.

6. PERSONAL:
- "Plan personal life first, business second." (New 2025 perspective). Leverage judgment over hours.
- "The Third Marshmallow": It's okay to make money. You can't delay gratification forever or you die with a stack of crumbs.
